      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <h5>January, 1937</h5>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hOVoQNY.jpg">
      <p>Greetings, My name is Ida Mae Brandon Gladney. I am an African-American woman that currently resides in a part of the Jim Crow South in the rural part of Mississippi. The Jim Crow Laws have created a hard life to live with my husband in segregation. My husband, George, is a sharecropper who picks cotton day after day for wealthy white men who could care less about his and my wellbeing. In reality, I could not express how much I love George; or pumpkin, as I call him. He is so down to earth and when we see each other after a long day, neither of us can stop smiling. I wish George and I could live in our own separate world rather than living in a place that is filled with constant dangers for us and our family members. A couple of days ago, one of my family members, my cousin. A few nights ago my cousin was attacked because a couple of white males used leveraged the color of their skin to his advantage and accused him of “stealing something”. They used that to beat him to the ground and nearly kill him until authorities arrived at the scene. My life here in the South is not getting any prettier and will most likely get worse with more of these lynchings and attacks happening more often. This makes me want to find peace and enjoy life with my husband. For me and my fellow people of color, there is no justice for us here.

      <h2>Segregation</h2>
      <h5>February, 1937</h5>
      <img src="https://civilwarinvirginia.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/greatmigration.jpg">
      <p>As a child, I experienced segregation and the evil machine that is racism.  My first experience with racism was when I was very young, I was walking on the sidewalk, a white man started walking towards me and my mother got off the sidewalk and told me to follow her. Only I was playing a game where I couldn’t step on the cracks and it would mess me up. So I kept walking. As the man got closer he sneered and me and shouted horrible things to my mother about how she should keep me in line. I never felt the same after that, for I knew that my life would be different than the lives of that man's children. This continued in school as we were given the worse books and our parents the worst pay, not allowing us to pull yourself out of the situation. That's why I wanted to move North. To get out of all of that and break free of the chains holding me back.

      <h2>My Ambitions and fears</h2>
      <h5>June, 1938</h5>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TB4KZw8.jpg">
      <p>I wanted to leave the South for many reasons, be it opportunity in the North or oppression down here, chief among them was to be able to live out my life to the fullest. This was not possible in the South, I was stunted and held back by segregation and not allowed to fly as far as I could. On top of this, one of my family members was almost killed over a simple accident, which put me on edge. So, for fear of my life, I started the process moving North with the motivation of safety. This began in the early morning as I escaped Mississippi and traveled for Chicago one early morning. I immediately noticed how everything was different, not only did I feel freer but things looked different, people acted different. I wasn't in Chickasaw county, Mississippi anymore.

      <h2>Travelling problems</h2>
      <h5>February, 1939</h5>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xjyXqIK.png">
      <p>Always being squished between two people or having to stand as tall as I could to not lose sight of George; that was a constant result of traveling up through the southern states with hundreds of people. If making sure that I did not get separated with my family was not enough I always had to be on the lookout for policemen. Policemen waited on railway platforms and arrested any black person holding a suitcase. It was almost like they were competing with each other for who can arrest the most blacks. However, making sure to stay out of any negative interactions, even any interactions with whites could be even worse. “Woman, watch where you are going”, or “Lady, whatcha think you are doing”. Those were among the nicer words white people said to me on the platforms. I was able to ignore them though, I had experienced much worse in Mississippi. I honestly prefer the quietness of working in the fields in Mississippi. Oh, but do not get me wrong, I would much rather be in between two sweaty old men, talking over me about whether the stocks would ever rise, than back in Mississippi, working 70 hours a week in the blazing hot fields.

      <h2>The Arrival</h2>
      <h5>July, 1939</h5>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tDHCOfu.jpg">
      <p>To me, life is a long book and that book is divided into individual chapters. At the end of a book there is always a final chapter. This post is giving me the feeling that this will be the conclusion to my journey of living in fear and threat on my journey towards asylum. Years back when I first reached the city of Chicago, I felt that this is not what my hard work and grit should buy me. Settling into my new home in the city was tough on me. The workforce still bounced me and my husband around through jobs I never thought I would have had. One job my husband had was hauling ice up four and five flights of stairs in the cold water flats of Chicago. When George and I arrived Chicago, we discovered it difficult to get settled. We did not have the dexterities to find work in the city. My husband, George ended up hauling ice up four and five flights of stairs in the cold-water flats of Chicago. I did odd domestic jobs before I finally found work as a hospital aide. "It took us decades really to get situated before they were able to afford to buy a home on the South side of Chicago.

      <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
      <h5>January, 1989</h5>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JX9iMpZ.jpg">
      <p>I expected that George and I would have had to work our way to find peace and tranquility but I never knew it would take as long as it did. Finally I found a job as a housemaid where I felt comfortable and built up enough money to later buy me and my husband a house on the South side of Chicago where we finally realized we had reached the end of our journey to safety and peace. The world will never be perfect. We knew that when we moved to chicago, there would still be people who believe differently but now I can feel confident that fighting segregation and discrimination was never about power and the fight. We didn’t escape because of our physical strength. It was our mental strength that allowed us to contain our dignity to the win the fight through silent resistance. Now I can feel confident that future generations will follow in our footsteps to freedom.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Ida Mae Gladney was a real person who was born in 1917 in Chickasaw County, Mississippi. She lived until 1937 when she migrated to Chicago for a better life. She is a main focus of Isabel Wilkerson Warmth of Other Suns, a book detailing the primary accounts of the great migration, when over six million  African-Americans migrated North and West for better opportunity and to escape the southern oppression as a African-American. Wilkerson provides a macrohistorical view of Ida Mae and that made us want to dive into the more microhistorical events of Ida Mae’s interesting and complicated life. We conceptualized a diary of Ida Mae based off what we could gather from Wilkerson’s book to form a fictional diary of Ida Mae detailing her move North and experiences before and after. This journal is fictional as we did not have access to Ida Mae. however, we did the best we could to provide a realistic account. All incidents and dialogue, and all characters with the exception of some well-known historical figures, are products of our imagination and are not to be construed as real. Where real-life historical figures appear, the situations, incidents, and dialogues concerning those persons are mostly fictional and are not intended to depict actual events or to change the entirely fictional nature of the work. In all other respects, any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental.
